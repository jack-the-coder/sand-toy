# sand-toy
Hey there! This is a fork of https://github.com/MaxBittker/sand-toy. 

It has a few relatively minor improvements over the original:
- Added oil
- Fixed a variety of window management and mouse bugs
- Supported window resizing at runtime
- Added (very WIP) user-controlled fluid material
- Cleaned up variable names, comments, and shader code

Best of all, the whole thing is only a few hundred lines of easy-to-understand code.
